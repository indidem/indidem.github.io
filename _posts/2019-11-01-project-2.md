***To properly demonstrate the scale of the research and see ‘who's who in the zoo', a map has been drawn from the main database records.***

The map is an actor-network diagram. Network diagrams are commonly used in contemporary **[social network analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis)** and are based on the **[actor-network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory)** of academic sociology. This format was chosen instead of the traditional **[family tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree)** or **[pedigree chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart)** because they tend to emphasise horizontal sibling relationships - which in this case, with up to 12,000 people involved, could lead to a map that's too unwieldy and unnavigable. 

That said, this map is complex and challenging to read, at least initially. It’s only at first draft and will continue to be refined and improved over time. 

To improve readability an *interactive* digital version is now available from Polinode. It's publicly accessible for the moment, although in the interests of privacy only limited information is displayed. In due course the map will be placed behind a secure access portal.
