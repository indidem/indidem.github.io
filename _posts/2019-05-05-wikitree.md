### About WikiTree

Out of the many genealogy websites available today, the Indidem project has adopted WikiTree. Through WikiTree we hope to enable Shirley's research to persist into the future, in circulation and informing similar research.

WikiTree is an online project aimed at building a single, shared family tree. It's also an active, dynamic community of volunteers, who collaborate on equal terms (since there are [no 'premium' memberships](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Community_Membership)), to ensure the research published on WikiTree is accurate and authentic.

### Why

WikiTree has been chosen for several important reasons.

The first reasons are that WikiTree is not owned or run by any kind of religious or for-profit organisation, and the [sensible folks](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:WikiTree_Team) who do run WikiTree have made [robust plans](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Protecting_Our_Shared_Tree) for future-proofing and protecting the database.

##### Collaboration

More importantly, it's a friendly community with a very active and supportive [forum](https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/). These features are supplemented by a wealth of [help](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:How_to_Use_WikiTree), on the website itself as well as on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEqK4ICkQWXSKJksGv3vx_XQjAHZzU2Qn) and a range of related personal family history websites, and [how to information on the blog](https://www.wikitree.com/blog/category/wikitree-how-to/). Altogether, these should help us learn how to use the system effectively, and by extension, help keep the work of migrating and finessing Shirley's research under control.

##### Profiles

A key aspect of WikiTree is ['one profile per person'](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Collaboration#Collaboration_means_one_profile_for_every_individual). This is the best approach for ensuring comprehensive family records, since they can often suffer from myths, inaccuracies, and missing data. Our project sees no advantage in systems that enable a proliferation of records, because reproducing errors, even accidental ones, can lead to disbelieving and diminishing the value of the research.

##### Privacy

Privacy is a major concern for our project, as it is for the whole internet these days. WikiTree has impressive privacy controls: no less than [7 tiers ranging from unlisted to public](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Privacy). This will allow for uploading Shirley's research in its entirety, while simultaneously securing the scores of profiles that are likely to identify living people (and any others that are a privacy concern for relatives or descendents).

##### Honour code

WikiTree has established an [honour code](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Special:Honor_Code) to help moderate behaviour and maintains standards. It's something that contributors are encouraged to sign, in order to participate fully and develop their own profiles, and it's actively policed by the community itself. This honour code will help protect Shirley's research, and ensure that all those who wish to collaborate and further develop their corner of it, abide by their best intentions.

##### Price

WikiTree is also the right price: **free**, with [guarantees to remain so](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:The_Free_Family_Tree). As a result, the only cost or obligation imposed on anyone else who's curious about Shirley research and interested in exploring it further is the honour code mentioned above.

### How

The work of migrating Shirley's research to WikiTree will be slow. Firstly, while WikiTree accepts GEDCOM format records, which can easily be produced via Gramps, the quantity of records per import is [capped at 5,000](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Splitting_a_GEDCOM). This has obvious implications for migrating a database of around 12,000 people. Also, WikiTree strives to achieve accuracy through reference to [sources](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Sources), which means that Shirley's data and archive will need to be closely assessed prior to migration, and some profiles may take time to write up. Consequently we may be best to proceed in batches, either by family group, starting with Shirley's immediately family, or according to specific request.

### Next steps

A start will be made on migrating Shirley's data at some point in the near future. At that point, the database linked to this website will be taken down, and the single source of truth for Shirley's research will become WikiTree.
