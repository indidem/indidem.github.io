item-intro: Shirley recorded her research in several databases.

---

In addition, a few different software options were explored over the years. Most were too difficult to use or didn't produce the kind of reports that Shirley was hoping to use in publishing her research.

### This Database

The database examined for this project was created in the [Personal Ancestral File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Ancestral_File) (PAF) software, a popular free program once produced by the Church of Latter Day Saints; support for the software was ended in 2013.

Work on this database started on Saturday 20/10/2001 and continued until Friday 24/08/2018.

### Conversion

One of the few file export options provided by PAF was the genealogy industry standard format [GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM).

After some research, the open source [Gramps Project](https://gramps-project.org/blog/) was identified as the best candidate for converting Shirley's data from a GEDCOM file into a more future-proof and program-independent format. Initially the goal was to produce a simple text-based file, like a csv, to complement a digital archive of Shirley's records and artefacts.

### Publication

Further exploration and experimenting resulted in finding a digital publishing option that went one better than a simple csv export. A standard Gramps report called [Narrated Web Site](https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_Reports_-_part_7#Narrated_Web_Site) was able to produce a mini-website, complete with indexes and interactive charts.

The database published here is intact and accurately reflects Shirley's research, up to the last edits in 2018; some details have been obscured for privacy reasons, though, as explained below.

Use the navigation menu to explore the database by each person's name and family name. Links within each record, including in the family tree chart at the bottom, will also take you to related records. To see when a particular record was last updated, check the "last change" statement at bottom of that particular page.

#### A note on privacy

To safeguard the privacy of all living people recorded in the database, *all entries without a death date* have been de-identified. For each, their first names have been replaced with the marker *[Living]*, plus birth dates and most notes have been removed; at the same time, connections to other family members, and any details contained in the notes of a deceased person or a life event, have been retained. 

This way of publishing the data has been adopted to meet the spirit of the European [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) (GDPR). [Historical research](https://gdpr.eu/article-89-processing-for-archiving-purposes-scientific-or-historical-research-purposes-or-statistical-purposes/), [archives](https://gdpr.eu/Recital-158-Processing-for-archiving-purposes/) and [genealogical records](https://gdpr.eu/Recital-160-Processing-for-historical-research-purposes/) are largely exempt from GDPR, which requires informed, voluntary consent for data collection, among other things.

We sincerely value the privacy of everyone identified and added to this database during the course of Shirley's research. If there are any oversights, errors or omissions, or if your presence in this database makes you feel uncomfortable, please tell us immediately via the main contact form. Please also note that the future direction for this data is for it to be transferred to Wikitree, as outlined in the Wikitree section of this website. The decision is partly due to the strength and range of Wikitree's [privacy controls](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Privacy).
