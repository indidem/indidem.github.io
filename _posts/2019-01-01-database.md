item-intro: Shirley recorded her research in several databases.

---

In addition, a few different software options were explored over the years. Most were abandoned as the software was too cumbersome to use or didn't allow sufficient recording of and reporting on all the people that Shirley was collecting.


### This Database

The first database explored for this project was created in the [Personal Ancestral File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Ancestral_File) (PAF) software, a popular free program once produced by the Church of Latter Day Saints; support for the software was ended in 2013.

The current data set debuted on Saturday 20/10/2001 with an impressive start of 902 records, including 791 people and 111 family names; these were possibly part of an earlier database. Work on this set continued until 7 people & 8 family names were added on Friday 24/08/2018.

### Conversion

One of the few file export options provided by PAF was the genealogy industry standard format [GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM).

After some research, the open source [Gramps Project](https://gramps-project.org/blog/) was found to be useful for receiving Shirley's data as a GEDCOM file, then exporting to csv, or another program-independent format. Initially the goal was to simply extract data into a format that could complement a digital archive of Shirley's records and artefacts, and provide a searchable, sustainable context for the scanned documents.

### Publication

After further exploration and experimenting it was found that the whole database could be published via this web site using Gramps' [Narrated Web Site Report](https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_Reports_-_part_7#Narrated_Web_Site).

So, at least for the time being, you can visit and explore [Shirley's entire database](database/index.html).

### Privacy

*Regarding 'entire'* : the database published here is intact and unchanged from Shirley's last edits. 

However, to safeguard the privacy of those included in the database, *all people who have no death date recorded* in Shirley's database have been de-identified: for each, their first names have been replaced with the marker *[Living]*, plus dates and most notes have been removed. Connections to other family members, and any details contained in the notes of a deceased person or a life event, have been retained.

This way of publishing the data has been adopted to meet the spirit of the European [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) (GDPR). [Historical research](https://gdpr.eu/article-89-processing-for-archiving-purposes-scientific-or-historical-research-purposes-or-statistical-purposes/), [archives](https://gdpr.eu/Recital-158-Processing-for-archiving-purposes/) and [genealogical records](https://gdpr.eu/Recital-160-Processing-for-historical-research-purposes/) are largely exempt from GDPR, which requires informed, voluntary consent for data collection, among other things.

At the same time, we sincerely value the privacy of all the people collected during the course of Shirley's research. If there are any oversights, errors or omissions with regards to applying privacy controls to this database, please tell us immediately via the main contact form. Similarly, if your presence in this database makes you feel uncomfortabble and you would like to be removed, please contact us.

Please also note that the future direction for this data is to be transferred, in part or entirely, to Wikitree. Wikitree has been chosen for several reasons, one of which is the strength and range of their [privacy controls](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Privacy).
