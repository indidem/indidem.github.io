***Shirley recorded her research in several databases.***

In addition, a few different software options were explored over the years. Most were abandoned as the software was too cumbersome to use or didn't allow sufficient recording of and reporting on all the data that Shirley was collecting.

**This Database**

The first database explored for this project was created in the [Personal Ancestral File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Ancestral_File) (PAF) software, a popular free program once produced by the Church of Latter Day Saints; support for the software was discontinued in 2013.

The current data set debuted on Saturday 20/10/2001 with an impressive start of 902 records, including 791 people and 111 family names. Work on this database continued until 7 people & 8 family names were added on Friday 24/08/2018.

**Conversion**

One of the few file export options provided by PAF was the genealogy industry standard format GEDCOM (GED).
After some research, the open source Gramps project was identified as capable of receiving GED files and exporting to a range of other program-independent formats.
Initially the goal was to simply extract data from the original PAF file into a sustainable archive-ready format, that could ship with a digitsed version of Shirley's records and artefacts, and provide guidance on the contents of the archive.

**Publication**

After further exploration and an upgrade to the latest version of Gramps, the navweb export option in Gramps was used to produce a micro-website that published the entire database.
