As mentioned at the top of this website, Shirley's research collection includes a substantial pile of notes and documentary evidence. A separate collection of photos has also been assembled. Considerable further investigation and review is needed, as well as some form of digitising. After weeding, WikiTree will be useful for [publishing](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Uploading_Documents) some, but it may not be appropriate for all items. An archive may be developed, but questions remain as to how it might be made accessible for those with a need to use or refer to it.
