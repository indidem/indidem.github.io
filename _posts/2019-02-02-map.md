Some instructions on using this *interactive* map:
* **To move around the map:**
  * Click and drag with your mouse or use the arrow keys on your keyboard.
  * To zoom in and out, use the scroll wheel on your mouse if you have one, or press the up and down arrows on your keyboard together with the spacebar (ie, zoom in = up arrow + spacebar, zoom out = down arrow + spacebar). 
  * To zoom out completely, and see the whole map at once, press s on your keyboard.
* **To locate a particular person:**
  * Use the search box in the right hand panel to find them by name. *Living people are partly de-identified*: only the initial of their first name is present, so you may need to search by family name.
  * When a person is selected on the map, the other people they're connected to will also be highlighted; for a list of these people, click on the Edges tab in the right hand panel.
* **Understanding shapes:** 
 * This digital version of the map uses round dots for a woman, while square dots indicate a man; where a person's gender is unknown, a diamond shape is used.
 * Like with the poster version, larger dots indicate a person with many relationships.

### About This Map

This map was created to show all the people present in Shirley's database, both in one view, and in relation to Shirley herself; at the same time it demonstrates the scale of Shirley's research.

The map is a type called an actor-network diagram. Actor-network diagrams are often used in [social network analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) and are based on the [actor-network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory) of academic sociology. In these diagrams a set of people (*actors*) are displayed as a group, which is organised according to how they connect or relate to each other (in a *network*).

This format was chosen instead of the traditional [family tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree) or [pedigree chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart) because they tend to emphasise horizontal sibling relationships, and as a result, 'go wide' very quickly. In this case, with so many thousands of people involved, a traditional tree would be huge and unreadable.

### Data

The map was drawn using data from Shirley's database. 

Firstly, data was exported to some simple text-based files (csv) using Gramps, the program that also produced the online database. The data was then tidied, for instance so that dates were written in a standard format, from which a century of birth could be identified; the cleaning and analysing process took several months. The data was then organised into a list of people (*nodes*, aka *actors*) and a list of all connections between two people (*edges*) for creating the map. 

After some research into map types and software options, the Australian platofrm [Polinode](https://polinode.com/) was chosen. Polinode produces beautiful maps and is easily accessible because it's cloud-based. 

## Layout

More importantly, Polinode comes with sophisticated layout options that group parts of the network into clusters, according to the various connections (*edges*) present between each person (*node*). 

*To apply a new layout to the map, click on Layout in the left hand panel, then choose 'Force directed' from the drop-down list in the bottom panel, then click the Start button. Note, your layout will not save; if you want to keep a copy of your results, try one or more of the Export options in the left hand panel.* 

The layout options can take a long time to run before the nodes are all arranged in logical groups; this is partly because there's so much data to compute, but also because the data starts off scattered randomly. The layout used in the poster took about 12 hours to perfect; the layout available through Polinode now is different due to final changes made to the data.

### Colouring

Polinode also helps distinguish between individuals and groups using different colours and shapes. Polinode is able to show different colours for all 2,119 families identified in Shirley's database. 

When coloured by family name, the map is fascinating but a little overwhelming, and it needs to be interactive to be understandable. For printing on the poster and appreciating Shirley's research at a glance, the variety was reduced to about a dozen 'clan' groups. 

The 'clans' that were assembled for colouring the map are are a result of artificial and somewhat idiosyncratic choices. The goal was to show Shirley's family history in relation to Shirley herself. So the families chosen to 'lead' each 'clan' were ones that could show her story

#### A note on privacy

To safeguard the privacy of all living people recorded in the database, who have been included in this map, *all entries without a death date* have been partly de-identified. For each, their first names have been replaced with the marker *[Living]*, plus birth dates and most notes have been removed; at the same time, connections to other family members have been retained, and identifying remarks may exist in the notes of a deceased person or a life event. 

This map will only be available online temporily, after which it will be
